  <h2>
  Routine Explained...
    </h2>
    <p>
In the morning monday through friday during quarantine, I wake up go straight to the bathroom and take a shower. After my shower I brush my teeth, wash my face and do my HAIR. My hair can take from 45 minutes to an hour, and I never leave the house without it done... just ask my mom. After my hair I go eat a bowl of cereal and get ready for work or to do school work. On my work days I go to work from 9:30am to 2:30pm. Before I was working i would do school work from 2:45 to 6:30 and am on a schedule.On the weekend I wake up do my hygine and chill out for the rest of the day.
